# Burger Eater

* Burger Eater lets users enter burger names for consumption.
    * Submitted burgers that have not been devoured are listed on the left with a `Devour it!` button
    * Clicking the button removes it from the left list and displays it on the right as devoured
    * All burgers are stored in a database with their devour status.
